To open the input waveforms, please use the following steps:
1. Each folder in the repository named Baseline Method, Combination 1 and Combination 2 have Input folders.
2. Open the input folder and the input folder will have three subfolders namely 80, 100 and 120. 
3. Each folder e.g. 80 has one abdomen, three heart and three lung files as they indicate the change in delta T1. 
4. Load these csv files in matlab and write a code to extract rows and columns which would be saved in certain variables. 
5. Those variables would be entered in the repeating sequence block in Simulink which will then represent the waveform which we have made.
